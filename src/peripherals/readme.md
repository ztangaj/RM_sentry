This folder contains the source code driving the STM32's peripherals (and other hardware capabilities), the code of actual features built on top of these peripherals should not be included here.

You should consider adding your code here if:
1. Your code modifies the usage of any pin
2. Your code directly interface with the STM32 chip's hardware (CRC, CAN, Flash etc)
